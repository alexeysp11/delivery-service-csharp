Name: **Maintenance**.

`maintenance` is a business process implementation pattern that is usually associated with supporting the functionality of a client application, backend service or business process.

Such processes begin their execution on the backend service after a call from another service or by a trigger, and can also send a notification to the user about the need to perform some action and process the result of this action.
