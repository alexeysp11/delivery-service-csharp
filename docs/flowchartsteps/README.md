A [flowchart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart) is a type of diagram that represents a workflow or process. A flowchart can also be defined as a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm, a step-by-step approach to solving a task.
The flowchart shows the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting the boxes with arrows.

[Workflow](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/workflow) is the sequence of industrial, administrative, or other processes through which a piece of work passes from initiation to completion.

A [business process](../processes/README.md) on this platform is understood as a rather simple and isolated sequence of actions.
In the case of complex coordination between processes, it is better to distinguish the so-called [flowchart steps](../flowchartsteps/README.md), or steps of a flowchart diagram (for example, complete order processing, preparation, delivery and payment in a general sense can be considered as one [flowchart diagram](../flowchartnames/README.md)).
