Name: **IVR system**.

The process responsible for implementing interactive voice response (IVR) systems involves creating a system that can interact with callers through voice prompts and DTMF tones to gather information or provide automated responses. 
This may include designing call flows, recording voice prompts, integrating with backend systems, and handling user input.

Responsible modules: [client application](../../frontend/adminclient.md), [backend service](../../backend/adminbackend.md)
