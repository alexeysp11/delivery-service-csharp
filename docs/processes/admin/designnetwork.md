The process responsible for planning/designing the network in the delivery service app involves creating a comprehensive network architecture that meets the app's requirements for scalability, reliability, and security. This includes determining the hardware and software components needed, defining network topologies, and considering factors such as data storage, communication protocols, and network security measures.

The process for planning and designing the WIFI network in the delivery service app involves assessing the physical layout of the delivery locations, determining the required coverage areas, selecting appropriate access points and controllers, and creating a network design that ensures reliable and secure connectivity for delivery personnel and customers. This process may have some commonalities with the process for designing a corporate network, such as considering security measures and scalability, but the specific requirements and considerations for a delivery service app may differ.
